# ðŸ¤–gloveworks_screenshot_bot

## About
### This is a discord screenshot bot specifically for the Counter Strike Community: Gloveworks
![result](docs/result.png)

## Purpose
### Gloveworks hosts a monthly contest where the top player can receive a prize. However, there have been times where it has been uncertain who was the top player on the last day of the month at exactly 7 PM PST. That's what this bot aims to solve! This Discord Bot will take a screenshot of a website on the last day of the month at 7 PM PST. It also allows you to request a screenshot on demand.

## Prerequisite
### A linux machine configured with PST time
### A docker engine on your machine: please feel free to consult the Docker Website on how to install it.
### A discord bot created through the Discord Developer Portal - I will show you how to do this
### 2 GBs

## How does it work?
### The python script is what activates the bot, but the python libraries is what makes the magic happen
* python3-discord (python module for discord APIs)
* python3-selenium (python module for selenium - supports screenshots and much more automation)
* apscheduler (python module allows us to choose when the bot wakes up and takes a screenshot)
* discord_ext_bot (python module for discord bot APIs)
* webdriver_manager (python module for spinning up chromium from python)
### The docker image is just a nice way to package all of the dependencies that is required by the python script, and also freeze the software such that Gloveworks can dependently rely on this bot. It uses an existing docker image seleniarm/standalone-chromium, which is a modified Debian Linux image that supports automation capabilities inside docker.
